"""
    Data models exchanged between macOS command runners, execution
    aspects, and the higher-level sysman features.

    The macOS runners share the same conceptual model as the Ubuntu
    runners: every execution returns a :class:`MacosRunResult`, every
    in-flight command flows through a :class:`MacosExecutionContext`,
    and SSH-shaped reliability metrics are tracked on a single
    :class:`MacosSshReliabilityMetrics` dataclass that is also reused
    by the local runner for parity.

    The cross-cutting :class:`automojo.interfaces.icommandrunner.RunResult`
    is re-exported from this module under the alias ``RunResult`` so
    callers that only need the interface-level type can import from a
    single place.
