# Requirements

## Introduction

This spec implements the process-management contract defined at
`automojo-sysman-common/specs/contracts/process-management/contract.md`
for macOS using BSD `ps`, `kill`, `pkill`, `pgrep`, `renice`, and
`nohup`.

The process-management feature provides the `automojo-sysman-macos`
package with the ability to enumerate, inspect, terminate, spawn,
prioritise, wait for, and search for arbitrary user-space processes on
macOS.  A maintenance coordinator running in an external package drives
all operations by calling into this feature's public interfaces.  The
feature does not decide *which* processes to manage — it provides the
capability to *do it* reliably, idempotently, and with full
auditability.  All system commands are executed exclusively through
the `automojo-interfaces` command-runner abstraction, enabling dry-run
simulation, auditing, and test mocking without requiring a live system.

This feature mixes **read** verbs (`list_processes`, `get_process`,
`find_processes_by_name`, `wait_for_process`) and **write** verbs
(`kill_process`, `kill_process_tree`, `start_process`,
`set_process_priority`).  Per the cross-OS contract:

- Writes are dry-run-aware and idempotent where the verb's nature
  permits.  They never raise on failure; failures surface as
  `MacosProcessActionResult` records with `status=FAILED`.
- Reads never elevate.  They raise `MacosProcessQueryError` for
  unexpected failures; an unknown PID on `get_process` surfaces as
  `None` rather than an exception.
- Writes elevate when `config.elevated=True`.

### Differences from the Linux pilots

- BSD `ps` uses `-A` for "all processes" (Linux's `-e` is also
  accepted but `-A` is the documented switch).  The column-name
  aliases for percent-CPU / percent-memory differ — BSD uses
  `%cpu` / `%mem` rather than the Linux `pcpu` / `pmem`.
- BSD `pgrep` has no `-a` flag; `pgrep -l` is the canonical
  "long" output that prints `<pid> <command-name>`.  Argv
  recovery requires a follow-up `ps -p` lookup.
- macOS does not ship `setsid`.  `start_process` uses
  `nohup sh -c '<argv> &'` to detach the spawned process from the
  controlling terminal.
- `ps` on macOS prints a header row by default; the parser drops
  any row whose first token is non-numeric so we do not have to
  rely on a missing-on-macOS `--no-headers` switch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enumerate Running Processes

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to list every
running process on the host with PID, parent PID, owner, state, nice
value, memory footprint, and command line, so that I can inventory the
running workload before taking any action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls `list_processes()` THE SYSTEM SHALL
   invoke `ps -A -o pid,ppid,user,stat,pri,ni,vsz,rss,%cpu,%mem,
   etime,comm,args` via the command runner with `elevated=False`.
2. WHEN the coordinator passes `owner=<username>` THE SYSTEM SHALL
   invoke `ps -U <username> -o <format>` (BSD `ps` uses `-U`, not
   `-u`).
3. THE SYSTEM SHALL parse every output row into a
   `MacosProcessInfo` populating `pid`, `ppid`, `user`, `state`,
   `priority`, `nice`, `vsz`, `rss`, `cpu_percent`, `mem_percent`,
   `elapsed`, `command`, and `argv`; the parser SHALL drop any row
   whose first token is non-numeric so the BSD-`ps` header row is
   ignored without a switch.
4. WHEN `ps` returns a non-zero exit code THE SYSTEM SHALL raise
   `MacosProcessQueryError` carrying the argv, exit code, and stderr.
5. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT pass `elevated=True` for this call.

---

### Requirement 2: Inspect a Single Process

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to look up a
single process by PID, so that I can confirm its existence, owner, and
nice value before issuing a write.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls `get_process(pid=<pid>)` THE SYSTEM
   SHALL invoke `ps -p <pid> -o <format>` via the command runner with
   `elevated=False`.
2. WHEN `ps` exits 0 with one parsed row THE SYSTEM SHALL return the
   parsed `MacosProcessInfo`.
3. WHEN `ps -p` exits non-zero with empty stderr (the canonical
   "unknown PID" shape) THE SYSTEM SHALL return `None`.
4. WHEN `ps -p` exits non-zero with non-empty stderr THE SYSTEM SHALL
   raise `MacosProcessQueryError`.
5. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT pass `elevated=True` for this call.

---

### Requirement 3: Find Processes by Name

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to search for
running processes by name pattern, so that I can locate every instance
of an application without enumerating the entire process table.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls `find_processes_by_name(name=<pattern>)`
   THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke `pgrep -l <pattern>` via the command runner
   with `elevated=False`.
2. WHEN `pgrep` exits 0 THE SYSTEM SHALL parse each line of the form
   `<pid> <command>` into a `MacosProcessInfo` whose `pid` and
   `command` fields are populated.
3. WHEN `pgrep` exits 1 (its canonical "no matches" code) THE SYSTEM
   SHALL return an empty list, not raise.
4. WHEN `pgrep` exits with any other code THE SYSTEM SHALL raise
   `MacosProcessQueryError`.
5. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT pass `elevated=True` for this call.

---

### Requirement 4: Terminate a Process

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to deliver a
POSIX signal to a running process, so that I can request graceful
termination, force termination, or arbitrary signals such as `HUP`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls `kill_process(pid=<pid>, signal=<sig>)`
   THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke `kill -<sig> <pid>` via the command runner.
2. WHEN `signal` is omitted THE SYSTEM SHALL substitute
   `config.default_signal` (defaulting to `"TERM"`).
3. WHEN `signal` is not in the supported set
   `{TERM, KILL, HUP, INT, QUIT, USR1, USR2}` THE SYSTEM SHALL raise
   `ValueError`; it SHALL NOT invoke the runner.
4. BEFORE invoking `kill`, THE SYSTEM SHALL probe the PID via
   `get_process`; WHEN the PID is no longer present THE SYSTEM SHALL
   return `MacosProcessActionResult` with status `SKIPPED`.
5. WHEN `dry_run=True` THE SYSTEM SHALL return status `DRY_RUN` and
   SHALL NOT invoke the runner.
6. WHEN the `kill` command exits 0 THE SYSTEM SHALL return status
   `SUCCESS`.
7. WHEN the `kill` command exits non-zero THE SYSTEM SHALL return
   status `FAILED` carrying the exit code, stdout, and stderr.
8. THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `elevated=config.elevated` to the runner for
   the `kill` invocation.

---

### Requirement 5: Terminate a Process Tree

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to terminate a
process and all of its direct children, so that runaway worker pools
can be reaped without leaving orphans behind.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls
   `kill_process_tree(pid=<pid>, signal=<sig>)` THE SYSTEM SHALL
   invoke `pkill -<sig> -P <pid>` first and then `kill -<sig> <pid>`,
   in that order.
2. WHEN `pkill -P` exits 1 (its canonical "no children matched" code)
   THE SYSTEM SHALL treat the children sweep as a non-failure and
   continue to the root kill.
3. WHEN `pkill -P` exits with any other non-zero code THE SYSTEM
   SHALL annotate the final result's `detail` with
   `"(child sweep exit=<code>)"` but SHALL NOT override the root
   kill's status.
4. THE SYSTEM SHALL apply the same dry-run, idempotency, signal
   validation, and elevation rules as `kill_process`.

---

### Requirement 6: Start a New Process

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to spawn a new
process from a structured spec, so that arbitrary helper commands can
be issued under the same auditable runner path used by every other
verb.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls `start_process(spec=<spec>)` THE SYSTEM
   SHALL build the argv `["nohup", "sh", "-c",
   "<shell-quoted argv> &"]` from `spec.executable + spec.args`.
   ``nohup`` is used because macOS does not ship ``setsid``.
2. THE SYSTEM SHALL forward `spec.working_dir` to the runner as `cwd`
   and `spec.env` as `env`.
3. WHEN `dry_run=True` THE SYSTEM SHALL return status `DRY_RUN`
   without invoking the runner.
4. WHEN the runner exits 0 THE SYSTEM SHALL return status `SUCCESS`.
   On `SUCCESS` THE SYSTEM SHALL attempt a best-effort PID lookup via
   `pgrep -l <spec.executable>` and populate `pid` with the most
   recent match (or leave it `None` when no match is found).
5. WHEN the runner exits non-zero THE SYSTEM SHALL return status
   `FAILED` carrying the exit code, stdout, and stderr.
6. THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `elevated=config.elevated` to the runner.
7. THIS PILOT documents that `start_process` is effectively
   synchronous: the runner blocks until the wrapping shell exits.
   True detached / async-spawn semantics are out of scope for the
   pilot and recorded in `tasks.md`.

---

### Requirement 7: Adjust Process Priority

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to renice a
running process, so that long-running workloads can be backgrounded
without restarting them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls
   `set_process_priority(pid=<pid>, priority=<n>)` THE SYSTEM SHALL
   invoke `renice <n> -p <pid>`.
2. WHEN `dry_run=True` THE SYSTEM SHALL return status `DRY_RUN`
   without invoking the runner.
3. THE SYSTEM SHALL probe the current nice value via `get_process`;
   when the existing `nice` already equals `priority` THE SYSTEM SHALL
   return status `SKIPPED` and SHALL NOT invoke `renice`.
4. WHEN `renice` exits 0 THE SYSTEM SHALL return status `SUCCESS`.
5. WHEN `renice` exits non-zero THE SYSTEM SHALL return status
   `FAILED`.
6. THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `elevated=config.elevated` to the runner.

---

### Requirement 8: Wait for a Process to Exit

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to wait for a
process to exit with an optional timeout, so that orchestration
pipelines can pause until prior work has settled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator calls
   `wait_for_process(pid=<pid>, timeout_seconds=<t>)` THE SYSTEM SHALL
   poll `kill -0 <pid>` at the configured cadence.
2. WHEN `kill -0` exits non-zero (the PID is gone) THE SYSTEM SHALL
   return `MacosProcessWaitResult(pid=<pid>, exit_code=None,
   timed_out=False)`.
3. WHEN `timeout_seconds` is supplied AND the elapsed wall-clock time
   reaches it before the PID disappears THE SYSTEM SHALL return
   `MacosProcessWaitResult(timed_out=True)` rather than raise.
4. WHEN `timeout_seconds=None` THE SYSTEM SHALL poll forever until the
   PID disappears.
5. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT pass `elevated=True` for any `kill -0` probe.
6. THE `exit_code` field MAY be left `None`; on macOS only the parent
   process can recover the exit code of a child via ``waitpid``.

---

### Requirement 9: Write Discipline

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want every write verb
to be safe under retry / persistence / timeout aspects, so that
process-management actions can be issued under whatever runner
configuration the coordinator already has set up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SYSTEM SHALL NEVER raise from a write verb.  Every write SHALL
   return `MacosProcessActionResult` with one of `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`,
   `SKIPPED`, `DRY_RUN`.
2. ON `FAILED` THE SYSTEM SHALL populate `exit_code`, `stdout`,
   `stderr`, and `command` on the result.
3. ON `SKIPPED` THE SYSTEM SHALL populate `command` with the argv that
   *would* have been executed and `detail` with a human-readable
   reason.
4. ON `DRY_RUN` THE SYSTEM SHALL populate `command` with the argv that
   *would* have been executed and SHALL NOT invoke the runner.
5. THE SYSTEM SHALL hold no state across calls beyond the injected
   runner and config.

---

### Requirement 10: Read Discipline

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want every read verb
to be strictly read-only and never elevate, so that I can collect
process state under aspect compositions that retry transient failures
without risking host mutation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Every runner invocation issued by `list_processes`, `get_process`,
   `find_processes_by_name`, and `wait_for_process` SHALL pass
   `elevated=False` regardless of `config.elevated`.
2. No read verb SHALL invoke a command that mutates host state.
3. The `wait_for_process` poll SHALL use signal `0` (`kill -0 <pid>`)
   so that no signal is actually delivered.

---

### Requirement 11: Aspect-Transparent Execution

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want every
process-management verb to be safe under retry / persistence / timeout
aspects, so that fleet-wide orchestration is not forced to special-case
this feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE manager SHALL accept an `ICommandRunner` and a
   `MacosProcessManagerConfig` in its constructor and SHALL hold no
   other mutable state.
2. EACH public verb SHALL parse only its own command's output; it
   SHALL NOT read across verbs (the
   `start_process` post-spawn `pgrep` lookup is a documented
   exception, not the rule).
3. WHEN a retry aspect re-runs a transient failure THE SYSTEM SHALL
   produce the same dataclass shape from the retried success that it
   would have produced from a first-try success.
