# Requirements

## Introduction

The user and group management feature provides the `automojo-sysman-linux-macos` package
with the ability to create, modify, and delete local users and groups on MacOS Linux
systems.  It also manages group membership, SSH authorized keys, account lock state, and
password expiry.

A maintenance coordinator running in an external package drives all operations by calling
into this feature's public interfaces.  The feature does not decide *which* users or groups
to manage — it provides the capability to *do it* reliably, idempotently, and with full
auditability.  All system commands are executed exclusively through the `automojo-interfaces`
command-runner abstraction, enabling dry-run simulation, auditing, and test mocking without
requiring a live system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Create a Local User

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want to create a local user account on the
system, so that the required system or service user is present for software that depends on
it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator provides a username THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke `useradd` with the
   supplied options via the command runner.
2. WHEN the user already exists THE SYSTEM SHALL skip execution and return a
   `UserActionResult` with status `SKIPPED`.
3. WHEN the coordinator specifies a UID THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `-u <uid>` to `useradd`.
4. WHEN the coordinator specifies a home directory THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `-d <home>` and
   `-m` to `useradd` to create it.
5. WHEN the coordinator specifies a login shell THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `-s <shell>` to
   `useradd`.
6. WHEN the coordinator specifies a primary group THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `-g <group>` to
   `useradd`.
7. WHEN the coordinator specifies a comment (GECOS) THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `-c "<comment>"`
   to `useradd`.
8. WHEN the coordinator sets `system_account=True` THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `-r` to `useradd`
   to create a system account with no home directory and no login shell by default.
9. WHEN the `useradd` command succeeds THE SYSTEM SHALL return a `UserActionResult` with
   status `SUCCESS`.
10. WHEN the `useradd` command fails THE SYSTEM SHALL return a `UserActionResult` with
    status `FAILED`, the exit code, and the captured stderr.
11. WHEN dry-run mode is active THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT execute any command and SHALL return a
    `UserActionResult` with status `DRY_RUN`.

the system, so that decommissioned or unwanted accounts are removed cleanly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator requests deletion of a user THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke `userdel
   <username>` via the command runner.
2. WHEN the coordinator sets `remove_home=True` THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `-r` to `userdel` to
   also remove the user's home directory and mail spool.
3. WHEN the user does not exist THE SYSTEM SHALL skip execution and return a
   `UserActionResult` with status `SKIPPED`.
4. WHEN the `userdel` command succeeds THE SYSTEM SHALL return a `UserActionResult` with
   status `SUCCESS`.
5. WHEN the `userdel` command fails THE SYSTEM SHALL return a `UserActionResult` with
   status `FAILED`, the exit code, and the captured stderr.

   SHALL invoke `usermod` with the corresponding flags via the command runner.
2. WHEN the user does not exist THE SYSTEM SHALL raise a `UserNotFoundError`.

provisioned or deprovisioned without modifying the full key file.

user account or force an immediate password expiry, so that password rotation requirements
are enforced on the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coordinator requests immediate password expiry for a user THE SYSTEM SHALL
   invoke `passwd --expire <username>` via the command runner.
2. WHEN the coordinator provides a maximum password age in days THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke
   `chage -M <days> <username>` via the command runner.
3. WHEN the coordinator provides a minimum password age in days THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke
   `chage -m <days> <username>` via the command runner.
4. WHEN the coordinator provides an account expiry date THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke
   `chage -E <YYYY-MM-DD> <username>` via the command runner.
5. WHEN the user does not exist THE SYSTEM SHALL raise a `UserNotFoundError`.
6. WHEN the command succeeds THE SYSTEM SHALL return a `UserActionResult` with status
   `SUCCESS`.
7. WHEN the command fails THE SYSTEM SHALL return a `UserActionResult` with status `FAILED`,
   the exit code, and the captured stderr.
8. WHEN dry-run mode is active THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT execute any command and SHALL return a
   `UserActionResult` with status `DRY_RUN`.

---

### Requirement 12: Elevated Privilege Execution

**User Story:** As a maintenance coordinator, I want all user and group write commands to
run with the privileges required by `useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd`, and related tools,
so that account management succeeds on a standard system where the process does not run
as root.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured to use sudo elevation THE SYSTEM SHALL pass `elevated=True`
   to the command runner for all write operations (create/delete/modify user, create/delete
   group, add/remove group member, manage SSH keys, lock/unlock, expire password).
2. WHEN performing read-only operations (query user, read authorized_keys) THE SYSTEM SHALL
   NOT use elevation.
3. WHEN the system is running as root THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT pass `elevated=True`.
4. WHEN the elevation configuration is not set THE SYSTEM SHALL default to no elevation and
   allow the command runner to surface the resulting permission error.
